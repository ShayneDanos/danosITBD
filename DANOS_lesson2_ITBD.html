			<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Pasig on November 8, 2002<sup>[1]</sup>. I’m the 4th child and I have 3 siblings<sup>[2]</sup>. It supposes to be 4 but my younger sister died a few days after she was born due to a lack of months<sup>[3]</sup>. In my childhood days, my only hobby is to play outside our house<sup>[4]</sup>. I usually play before with my friends in different games like ‘tagu taguan’, ‘bahay-bahayan’, etc.<sup>[5]</sup>. Then my mother will always scold me because of escaping from sleeping in the afternoon because she told me that it was important for me to grow up<sup>[6]</sup>. And in this days, I have less knowledge of using technology<sup>[7]</sup>. But later on, when I was in grade school that’s the day we’re I discovered using computers in an internet cafes or computer shops<sup>[8]</sup>. My sister thought me how to use it, at first I was kind of confused because I was young and has less knowledge of it<sup>[9]</sup>. But eventually, I got used to it, and keep coming back to it to play computer games with my friends<sup>[10]</sup>. I only use pc or computer in these days for gaming only not social media<sup>[11]</sup>. And the games I play that day are LOL or League of Legends and CF or Cross Fire<sup>
			[12]</sup>. Playing with friends is fun and I spend hours in there<sup>[13]</sup>. At this stage I don’t really know what would I be in the future<sup>[14]</sup>. I only think is what things I’ll to do for my own happiness<sup>[15]</sup>. And I didn’t realize that I became addicted to it<sup>[16]</sup>. Where I only spend my day playing and not studying or doing assignments<sup>[17]</sup>. This we’re my parent’s got mad at me because I have failing grades due to always playing computer games and not prioritizing my studies<sup>[18]</sup>. I lessen my hours playing computer games after then started doing and passing my assignments<sup>[19]</sup>. But even though I already lessen the time I spend playing, I still do not get high grades but passing grades or what they called ‘palakol grades’ because it’s full of ‘7’ numbers in every column<sup>[20]</sup>. Then my mother will just face-palm every time she sees my grades every quarter or grading<sup>[21]</sup>.</p></blockquote>

			<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time goes by and I’m already in my high school stage or this time it’s my teenage days<sup>[1]</sup>. I’m on my grade 7 year level and I was part of the section SPA or Special Program In Arts<sup>[2]</sup>. I have a lot of experience at that time like we are required to choose our specialization, in my first quarter I join to the folkloric club and the practice are so hard<sup>[3]</sup>. Then my parents got worried because I’m always coming home late due to practice dancing<sup>[4]</sup>. So I’ve come up with a decision to switch to a new specialization which is becoming part of the music club and under that, I became choir of our school<sup>[5]</sup>. It was so fun during the audition because I was nervous at that time because I’m not used to performing in front of many people<sup>[6]</sup>. But thankfully that I managed to finish it<sup>[7]</sup>. But sadly I was removed from that section because my average grade didn’t meet the standard grade<sup>[8]</sup>. But in grade 8, I’m no longer a member of the choir even though they still want me to be there but I refuse the opportunity because it’s not my passion<sup>[9]</sup>. My TLE in grade 8 is ICT and this where I learn how to use photoshop but only basics<sup>[10]</sup>. And this time I know now what am I going to pursue in the future and that's because of my sister<sup>[11]</sup>. My sister is BSCS at that time and they were doing their thesis at our house I saw and was amazed at what they do, and that is coding and I want to do it also so that is why I want to be a BSCS in college<sup>[12]</sup>.  But after my school year in grade 8, I make a wrong decision<sup>[13]</sup>. I want to be with my friends at that time so I choose cookery as my TLE in grade 9<sup>[14]</sup>. But it didn’t go as planned, because the teacher there doesn’t want any boys' students to be there so we (I’m not the only boy that chooses cookery) have no choice but to transfer to automotive class<sup>[15]</sup>. But to be honest I didn’t learn anything in my automotive class but I still pass or I got high grades there<sup>[16]</sup>.  Until grade 10 or 4th year of high school, I’m still in the automotive class<sup>[17]</sup>. On that days I already change and stop playing computer games and just focus on my studies until I finish 4th year and start a new journey as a senior high student<sup>[18]</sup>. On my SHS I choose the strand ICT Programming because I know to myself that I’m not good on hardware so I choose Programming instead<sup>[19]</sup>. And I learn a lot because I’m now focusing on my true interest. And this is also the time that I became conscious of my grades<sup>[20]</sup>.</blockquote></p>

			<mark class = "list">College</mark>
			<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least is my college days<sup>[1]</sup>. I’m kind of sad that time because my dream school or where my sister graduated didn’t accept me even though I have high grades and I really really want to be there<sup>[2]</sup>. But I still didn’t pass even though I have high grades and I pass my requirements early<sup>[3]</sup>. I remember that time I’m with my friends at SHS and we want to enroll in that school because its also their dream school, so together we prepare and gather our requirements and pass them on to the campus<sup>[4]</sup>. Out of us 8 friends only 1 passed or was accepted and even though happened we’re still proud that 1 of our friends become one of the students in that school<sup>[5]</sup>. Moving forward my auntie recommend me to be a UE student because that's her alma mater<sup>[6]</sup>. At first, I don’t agree with them because I know to myself that I’m not smart and it was also expensive, and that's why I think that I don’t deserve it<sup>[7]</sup>. But eventually, I agree already because my sister told me that it was okay and both of them will support me on my journey; all I have to do is give my best but they told me not to get 3.00 on my grades<sup>[8]</sup>. My first option is Computer Science but they want me to be in Computer Engineering but I told them I don’t agree with them<sup>[9]</sup>. At last I choose BSIT instead of Computer Engineering<sup>[10]</sup>. During the first-day classes I’m still adjusting to the new environment<sup>[11]</sup>. I distanced myself from my classmates and only a few friends I have that time<sup>[12]</sup>. Sadly the 2 of them didn’t continue to the second semester because of their own reasons or problems<sup>[13]</sup>. Still in 1st year but in the second semester I only have one friend<sup>[14]</sup>. And we have the same group in the project<sup>[15]</sup>. And thankfully that we got a perfect score on that project and we’re so proud of it<sup>[16]</sup>. That was a system made in MS Access and it's an enrollment system<sup>[17]</sup>. 2nd year (the first semester) my only friend didn’t become my classmate because I was a late enrollee and no slots were available in her section<sup>[18]</sup>. First semester as a sophomore and this time I met new friends I’m happy that I got more friends this year than last year and this is a true start of a challenge as a college student<sup>[19]</sup>. I learn new programming languages during the past year and this year; I will be focusing on it and will do my very best to have high grades<sup>[20]</sup>. 2nd semester and F2F started I met new people and friends but it was kind of hard for me because my home was too far and I have to wake up early like 4 am to get ready because my trip is almost 1hr to get to school<sup>[21]</sup>. It’s not the end of the story of my life, I still have more journeys to take and all I have to do is get used to it until the end<sup>[22]</sup>.</blockquote></p>
